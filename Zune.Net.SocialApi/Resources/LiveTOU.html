We refer to all of these as the "Service" and, except where context requires otherwise and even if not expressly referenced in the applicable section, “Service” includes any “Other Items” (defined in Section&nbsp;8(a)) that you may have obtained access to through or in relation to other aspects of the Service.&nbsp; To avoid any confusion, when you register to use the Service, you are registering for both the Xbox LIVE service sand the Games for Windows LIVE service s.</p><p>The Service is offered to you conditioned on your acceptance of all terms in this contract.&nbsp; By selecting "ACCEPT" below, you are representing that you are 18 years old (and have reached the “age of majority” if that is not 18 years of age where you live) and you are attaching your electronic signature to and agreeing to all terms in this contract.&nbsp; In addition, if you were a party to a prior version of this contract, that version may have stated that the contract can only be updated on 30 days’ notice.&nbsp; By selecting “ACCEPT” below, you are also agreeing to waive the applicability of this notice requirement.&nbsp; If you do not agree to this contract, in its entirety, or if you were a party to a prior version of this contract and do not agree to waive the notice requirement, you must select "DECLINE" and discontinue your registration, and you will have no right to use the Service.</p><p>You must have a Windows Live ID to register to use the Service. &nbsp;For additional information, see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100307155055/http://g.live.com/0HE_TRACKSTAR_ENUS9/127008">Get your Windows Live ID</a>. &nbsp;If you already have a Windows Live ID when you are registering for the Service, you can use this Windows Live ID; if you do not, a Windows Live ID will be automatically created for you.&nbsp; A Windows Live ID that is automatically created, however, will have functionality limited to use with the Service .&nbsp; If you wish to use an automatically-created Windows Live ID for purposes other than signing in to the Service, you must also agree to the applicable terms of use or terms of service for a general-purpose Windows Live ID.</p><p><strong>Please note that we do not provide warranties for the Service.&nbsp;

If any terms in this contract conflict with any Additional Terms, then the terms in this contract will control as applied to the Service and your legal relationship with Microsoft.&nbsp; Nothing in any Additional Terms will increase our legal liability or change your relationship with us (unless we are the contracting party identified in the Additional Terms, and we state, in the Additional Terms, our intent to modify the terms of this contract).&nbsp; The Additional Terms may, however, form an additional contract between you and a third party (for example, a third party that is offering content to you or sponsoring a tournament that you want to play in).&nbsp; Any dealings between you and such a third party are solely between you and the third party, and your relationship with the third party may be governed by the Additional Terms.&nbsp; We do not endorse and will not be responsible or liable for any aspect of any such dealings.&nbsp;</p><p>Certain features of the Service may be made available to you through web sites , online services or applicationsoperated by third parties.&nbsp; As above, your dealings with any of these third parties are solely between you and the applicable third party and may be governed by other terms or agreements that apply to those web sites and third party features and content.&nbsp;

If You Are An Associated Account User.</strong></p><p>If you are the user of an associated account, then the holder of the Service account has full control over your associated account.&nbsp; This control includes the right to end the Service, close or alter your associated account at any time, and, in some cases, to request and receive machine and Service usage information related to your associated account.&nbsp; As an associated account user, this contract applies to your use of the Service, except for the following Sections:&nbsp;6 (You are Responsible for Your Service Account); 8 (If You Pay Microsoft); and 26 (Notices We Send to You).</p><p><strong>8. &nbsp;If You Pay Microsoft.</strong></p><p><strong>a.&nbsp; Charges.</strong>&nbsp; This Section&nbsp;8 applies in all situations in which you directly pay us, whether that payment is for the Service (including renewals) or for any additional items and services (such as games, downloads, Service upgrades, or other premium features) that may be available for purchase through the Service (collectively, "Other Items").&nbsp;&nbsp; If you pay a company other than us for the Service, then the charges and billing terms are as stated by the other company.&nbsp; Even if you do not pay for the Service itself, you may still incur charges incidental to using the Service; for example, charges for Internet access, mobile text messaging, or other data transmission.</p><p><strong>b.&nbsp; Payment.</strong>&nbsp; When you create a billing account, you enter your payment method. &nbsp;You must be authorized to use the payment method.&nbsp; You authorize us to charge you for the Service <strong>and for any paid feature of the Service for which you choose to sign-up or use while this contract is in force</strong>using your payment method<strong>.</strong>&nbsp; You will pay all charges in advance.&nbsp; We may charge you a different amount than what you approved.&nbsp; If it is a greater amount, we will tell you the amount and the date of the charge at least 10 days before we make the charge.&nbsp; Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and notify you in advance of the difference.&nbsp; If your purchase is a subscription, we may bill you for more than one of your prior billing periods together, although we will not bill you more than once in any billing period for each such subscription.&nbsp; Other purchases (such as a one-time download) will be billed when the purchase is made.&nbsp; If we informed you that the Service will be provided indefinitely or automatically renewed, we may automatically renew your Service and charge you for any renewal term at the prices specified in Section&nbsp;8(e).&nbsp; In some cases relating to Service offers available on Xbox 360 consoles, you may have the option to create or renew a subscription with a prepaid card instead of your payment method.&nbsp; Your Service may be cancelled at the end of your subscription term if you do not have a billing account or have not elected to auto-renew your subscription with a charge to your payment method, or you have not entered a prepaid card for purposes of renewing your Service.&nbsp; If you sign up for an Xbox Live Gold Membership on an Xbox 360 console using a prepaid card, your subscription will continue but will downgrade to a free Xbox Live Silver Membership at the end of your pre-paid Gold membership period, regardless of whether you have a billing account .&nbsp; To maintain your Gold membership, you must set your account to automatically renew with a charge to your payment method ,or you must enter a new prepaid card.&nbsp; If you modify your Service from an original Xbox console to an Xbox 360 console, your Service will automatically renew annually at the then-current annual subscription price following the end of your current Service term (regardless of whether that current Service term is an annual or monthly term).</p><p><strong>c.&nbsp; Updates to Your Billing Account.</strong>&nbsp; You must keep all information in your billing account current, including your billing address and the expiration date of your credit card.&nbsp; You can access and make changes to your billing account via the “Account Management” section of the Xbox Dashboard, or if you access your Service via a personal computer, at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100307155055/https://billing.microsoft.com/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" onkeypress="window.open(this.href);return false;">https://billing.microsoft.com</a> . &nbsp;You may change your Payment Method at any time.&nbsp; If you tell us to stop using your payment method, we may cancel your Service.&nbsp; <strong>Your notice to us will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we reasonably could act on your request.</strong></p><p><strong>d. &nbsp;Trial Period Offers.</strong> &nbsp;You may have received access to the Service for a limited period of time free of charge.&nbsp; Unless we notify you otherwise, if you are participating in any trial period offer, you must cancel the applicable Service by the end of the trial period to avoid incurring charges. &nbsp;If you do not cancel the applicable Service , and we have informed you that the Service will automatically be converted into a paid subscription at the end of the trial period, then you authorize us to charge your payment method. &nbsp;If you do not have a billing account, then the applicable subscription will expire at the end of your trial period. &nbsp;If, however, you are participating in any Xbox Live Gold Membership trial period on an Xbox 360 console, your subscription will continue but will downgrade to a free Xbox Live Silver Membership at the end of your Gold membership trial period, regardless of whether you have a Billing Account.&nbsp; In this case, to maintain your Gold membership level, you must either set your Gold membership to automatically renew with a charge to your payment method, or you must enter a new prepaid card for the Service.</p><p><strong>e.&nbsp; Prices and Price Increases.</strong>&nbsp; Prices for the Service exclude all taxes and telecommunication charges, unless expressly stated otherwise.&nbsp; You are responsible for any taxes that you are obligated to pay or that we may collect from you.&nbsp; You are responsible for all other charges (for example, telecommunications charges).&nbsp; Currency exchange settlements are based on your agreement with your payment method provider. &nbsp;We may change the price of the Service from time to time upon notice to you.&nbsp;In addition, the price we set for certain features or functions in the Service may vary depending on whether the features or functions are accessed from Xbox LIVE or from Games for Windows LIVE, and we reserve the right to make various features or functions, in our sole discretion, available with or without charge from Xbox LIVE, Games for Windows LIVE, or both.</p><ul><li>If there is a specific time length and price for your Service offer, then that price will remain in force for that time. &nbsp;After the offer period ends, your use of the Service will be charged at the then current price.</li><li>If your Service is provided on a period basis (for example, monthly), with no specific time period, then we will notify you upon a price change.</li></ul><p>If you do not agree to these changes, then you must cancel and stop using the Service before the changes take place. &nbsp;If you cancel your Service, then (unless the terms of your subscription state otherwise) your Service subscription will end immediately.</p><p><strong>f.&nbsp; Refund Policies.</strong>&nbsp; Unless otherwise provided by law or in connection with any particular Service offer, all charges are non-refundable and the costs of any returns will be at your expense.&nbsp; There are, however, certain circumstances under which you may be entitled to a refund for certain Services.&nbsp; Additional information about refunds is available at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100307155055/http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/xbox360/xboxlive/myaccount/xboxliveaccountfaq/intro-accountfaq.aspx" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" onkeypress="window.open(this.href);return false;">http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/xbox360/xboxlive/myaccount/</a><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100307155055/http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/xbox360/xboxlive/myaccount/xboxliveaccountfaq/intro-accountfaq.aspx" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" onkeypress="window.open(this.href);return false;">xboxliveaccountfaq/intro-accountfaq.aspx</a>.</p><p><strong>g. &nbsp;Billing Statement;
